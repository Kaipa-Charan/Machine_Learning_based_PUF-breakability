# Machine_Learning_based_PUF-breakability

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are emerging as a promising technology for secure authentication and key generation. The XOR PUF, in particular, is a popular type of PUF that uses XOR logic gates to generate unique responses to challenge inputs. XOR PUFs have been studied extensively due to their simplicity and ease of implementation. However, recent research has shown that XOR PUFs can be vulnerable to attacks, and their security is highly dependent on the quality of their hardware implementation.

we explore the breakability of XOR PUFs using machine learning techniques. Machine learning has shown significant potential in analyzing and exploiting vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems. We hypothesize that machine.
